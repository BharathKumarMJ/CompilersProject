The folder is organized as follows : 

The main directory is the src/ which has all the C source files which perform the CSR and BlockedCSR multiplication.

Compiling the program:

make clean; make

Running the program:

python fileConverter.py <input_csr_matrix.mtx> <block_size_for_bcsr> - This generates a file which has a custom representation 
																		of BCSR that we use to parse. It is output in the same
																		folder as that of the input csr matrix

./main [-o] <input_csr_matrix.mtx> <generated_custom_bcsr_matrix> - This program does both the normal CSR multiplication
																	and the blocked multiplication. The option -o will output
																	the results to separate files for both.
